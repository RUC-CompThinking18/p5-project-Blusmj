# Interactivity
Your project responds to touch, which is great. As you say in your intro comment, you couldn't figure out how to change everything, which loses you a few points in this category.

# Code Quality
You produced clean code that runs without error, and you did really well at actually drawing with P5, which can be a frustrating experience.

I would have preferred to see a few more comments.

# Aesthetic Quality
I like the picture, especially the clouds. It would have been good to have a little more expressiveness or engagement with the project, but you did well with a limited amount of time.
